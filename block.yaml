  - name: # Identifier. Can be used for documentation, or in tasks/handlers.
    always: # List of tasks, in a block, that execute no matter if there is an error in the block or not.
    any_errors_fatal: # Force any un-handled task errors on any host to propagate to all hosts and end the play.
    become: # Boolean that controls if privilege escalation is used or not on Task execution. Implemented by the become plugin. See Become Plugins.
    become_exe: # Path to the executable used to elevate privileges. Implemented by the become plugin. See Become Plugins.
    become_flags: # A string of flag(s) to pass to the privilege escalation program when become is True.
    become_method: # Which method of privilege escalation to use (such as sudo or su).
    become_user: # User that you ‘become’ after using privilege escalation. The remote/login user must have permissions to become this user.
    block: # List of tasks in a block.
    check_mode: # A boolean that controls if a task is executed in ‘check’ mode. See Validating tasks: check mode and diff mode.
    collections: # List of collection namespaces to search for modules, plugins, and roles. See Using collections in a Playbook. Tasks within a role do not inherit the value of collections from the play. To have a role search a list of collections, use the collections keyword in meta/main.yml within a role.
    connection: # Allows you to change the connection plugin used for tasks to execute on the target. See Using connection plugins.
    debugger: # Enable debugging tasks based on state of the task result. See Debugging tasks.
    delegate_facts: # Boolean that allows you to apply facts to a delegated host instead of inventory_hostname.
    delegate_to: # Host to execute task instead of the target (inventory_hostname). Connection vars from the delegated host will also be used for the task.
    diff: # Toggle to make tasks return ‘diff’ information or not.
    environment: # A dictionary that gets converted into environment vars to be provided for the task upon execution. This can ONLY be used with modules. This isn’t supported for any other type of plugins nor Ansible itself nor its configuration, it just sets the variables for the code responsible for executing the task. This is not a recommended way to pass in confidential data.
    ignore_errors: # Boolean that allows you to ignore task failures and continue with play. It does not affect connection errors.
    ignore_unreachable: # Boolean that allows you to ignore task failures due to an unreachable host and continue with the play. This does not affect other task errors (see ignore_errors) but is useful for groups of volatile/ephemeral hosts.
    module_defaults: # Specifies default parameter values for modules.
    no_log: # Boolean that controls information disclosure.
    notify: # List of handlers to notify when the task returns a ‘changed=True’ status.
    port: # Used to override the default port used in a connection.
    remote_user: # User used to log into the target via the connection plugin.
    rescue: # List of tasks in a block that run if there is a task error in the main block list.
    run_once: # Boolean that will bypass the host loop, forcing the task to attempt to execute on the first host available and afterwards apply any results and facts to all active hosts in the same batch.
    tags: # Tags applied to the task or included tasks, this allows selecting subsets of tasks from the command line.
    throttle: # Limit number of concurrent task runs on task, block and playbook level. This is independent of the forks and serial settings, but cannot be set higher than those limits. For example, if forks is set to 10 and the throttle is set to 15, at most 10 hosts will be operated on in parallel.
    timeout: # Time limit for task to execute in, if exceeded Ansible will interrupt and fail the task.
    vars: # Dictionary/map of variables
    when: # Conditional expression, determines if an iteration of a task is run or not.
